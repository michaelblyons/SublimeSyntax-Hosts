This version is not a true continuation of the previous one.

The previous version was a package made by Rodrigo Flores. You probably once
installed it otherwise you would not see this message. It can still be found here:

    https://github.com/rodrigoflores/hosts

This new version is an entirely different project using machine generated
regular expressions to differentiate between private and public IP address
ranges. It will also not color any "impossible" IP addresses that you might
have spotted in some TV series. For more information please see README.md,
which is also hosted here:

    https://github.com/tijn/hosts.tmLanguage

We decided to replace the package because it has more precise patterns and it
supports anything that Rodrigo's package did. If you feel that this is not the
case, or if you found a bug, please open an issue on the GitHub page listed
above.
