Syntax Highlighting for /etc/hosts

# Features

It recognizes IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in a strict way. It won't match on 189.23.290.13 for example.

(Regular expression for IPv6 by David M. Syzdek was found here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/17871737/852657 . Any possible mistakes would be mine.)

It uses a different style for private IPv4 addresses. It supports all three private ranges as found on Wikipedia.
