Pedantic Syntax Highlighting for /etc/hosts

# Features

It highlights IPv4 and IPv6 addresses rigidly. For example: it won't match the impossible movie IP-address 189.23.290.13.

(Regular expression for IPv6 by David M. Syzdek was found here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/17871737/852657 . Any possible mistakes would be mine.)

It uses different styles for the private IPv4 address-ranges and public IPs. It supports all three private ranges as described on Wikipedia.
