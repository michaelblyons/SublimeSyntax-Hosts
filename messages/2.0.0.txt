Hosts
=====

Syntax highlighting (and shortcut keys) for your hosts file.

-----

Michael (https://github.com/michaelblyons) wrote the whole syntax definition
again in the new YAML-based format.

He added patterns to recognize private IPv6 ranges, and thus they are now
highlighed as such.

He also added hostname highlighting. This makes it really easy to recognize
illegal hostnames. (For example hostnames containing the wrong characters, or
ones that start with a minus '-', or hostnames that are simply too long.)

This is a major version release because the new YAML syntax file means ST2 is
not supported anymore.
